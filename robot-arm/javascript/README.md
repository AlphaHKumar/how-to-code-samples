## What it is

Using a compatible Intel速 IoT Platform, this project lets you create a robot arm that:<br>
- continuously checks the Grove\* Joystick.<br>
- moves two stepper motors based on the joystick control.<br>
- can be accessed via the built-in web interface to control the motors.

Additionally, the motors can be controlled individually via a web page served directly from the Intel速 IoT Platform.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to ground (GND) | 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Intel速 Edison board, just leave the `platform` key in the `config.json` set to `edison`. To configure the example for the Intel速 IoT Gateway, change the `platform` key in the `config.json` to `firmata` as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```
## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
