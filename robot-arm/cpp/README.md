# Robot arm

## Introduction

This robot arm application is part of a series of how-to Intel IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse\* IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to control a robot arm using a web page served up directly from the Intel® Edison board.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a robot arm that:

- continuously checks the Grove* Joystick;
- moves 2 stepper motors, based on the control of the joystick;
- can be accessed via a built-in web interface to control the motors;

## How it works

This example allows you to control a robotic arm using a thumb joystick. Each axis of the joystick corresponds to a motor to control.

Additionally, the motors can be controlled individually via a web page served up directly from the Intel® Edison board.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Robotics Kit containing:

1. Intel® Edison board with an Arduino* breakout board
2. Grove* Base Shield V2
3. [Grove* Thumb Joystick](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/joystick12.html)
4. [Stepper Motor Controller & Stepper Motor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/uln200xa.html) (x2)

## Software requirements

1. [Eclipse*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/eclipse-getting-started-guide)

## How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples.git

Want to download a .zip file? In your web browser, go to [https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples) and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Adding the program to Eclipse*

In Eclipse*, select **Import Wizard** to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

1. From the main menu, select **File > Import**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu.png)
2. The **Import Wizard** dialog box opens. Select **General > Existing Project into Workspace** and click **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-epiw.png)
3. Click **Select root directory** and then the associated **Browse** button to locate the directory that contains the project files.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-rootdir.png)
4. Under **Projects**, select the directory with the project files you'd like to import and click **OK** and then **Finish** to import the files into Eclipse*.<br>

5. Your main .cpp program is now displayed in your workspace under the **src** folder.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-src-loc.png)

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

You need to have a Grove* Base Shield V2 connected to the Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove* devices into the Grove* Base Shield V2. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Base Shield V2 set to **5V**.

You need to power the Intel® Edison board with the external power adapter that comes with your starter kit, or substitute an external **12V 1.5A** power supply. You can also use an external battery, such as a **5V** USB battery.

In addition, you need a breadboard and an extra **5V** power supply to provide power to both the motors. Note: you need a separate battery or power supply for the motors. You cannot use the same power supply for both the Intel® Edison board and the motors, so you need either 2 batteries or 2 power supplies in total.

1. Plug each of the stepper motor controllers into 4 pins on the Arduino* breakout board, for it to be able to be controlled. Connect stepper motor controller #1 to pins 4, 5, 6, and 7, and stepper motor controller #2 to pins 8, 9, 10, and 11. Connect both the controllers to ground (GND), to the **5V** power coming from the Arduino* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate **5V** power for the motors (VM).<br>

2. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* Joystick, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove* Base Shield V2.

### Intel® Edison board setup

This example uses the Crow* web micro-framework to provide a simple-to-use, yet powerful web server. The **crow** library requires the **libboost** package be installed on the Intel® Edison board, as well as adding the needed include and lib files to the Eclipse* Cross G++ Compiler and Cross G++ Linker.

1. Update opkg base feeds so you can install the needed dependencies. Establish an SSH connection to the Intel® Edison board and run the following command:<br>

        vi /etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf

2. Edit the file so that it contains the following:<br>

        src/gz all http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/all
        src/gz edison http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/edison
        src/gz core2-32 http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/core2-32

3. Save the file by pressing **Esc**, then **:**, then **q**, and **Enter**.

This only needs to be done once per Intel® Edison board, so if you've already done it, you can skip to the next step.

Install the **boost** libraries onto the Intel® Edison board by running the following command:

    opkg update
    opkg install boost-dev

### Copy the libraries

You need to copy the libraries and include files from the board to your computer where you're running Eclipse* so the Cross G++ Compiler and Cross G++ Linker can find them. The easiest way to do this is by running the `scp` command from your computer (NOT the Intel® Edison board), as follows:

    scp -r USERNAME@xxx.xxx.x.xxx:/usr/include/boost ~/Downloads/iotdk-ide-linux/devkit-x86/sysroots/i586-poky-linux/usr/include
    scp USERNAME@xxx.xxx.x.xxx:/usr/lib/libboost* ~/Downloads/iotdk-ide-linux/devkit-x86/sysroots/i586-poky-linux/usr/lib

Change `USERNAME@xxx.xxx.x.xxx` to match whatever username and IP address you set your board to.

Change `~/Downloads/iotdk-ide-linux` to match the location on your computer where you installed the Intel® IoT Developer Kit.

### Copy the libraries on Windows*

We have a helpful link to get this set up here:

[https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples/blob/master/cpp/docs/using-winscp.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples/blob/master/cpp/docs/using-winscp.md)

Note: you need to turn SSH on by running the `configure_edison --password` command on the board. Once you set the password, make sure you write it down. You only need to do this one time and it is set when you reboot the Intel® Edison board.

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board to Eclipse*

1. In the bottom left corner, right-click anywhere on the **Target SSH Connections** tab and select **New > Connection**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win.png)
2. The **Intel(R) IoT Target Connection** window appears. In the **Filter** field, type the name of your board.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win2.png)
3. In the **Select one of the found connections** list, select your device name and click **OK**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win3.png)
4. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Eclipse*.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow* web server.
We have a useful tutorial on how to use the shell script here:

[https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples/blob/master/cpp/docs/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples/blob/master/cpp/docs/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)

### Controlling the robot arm via a web browser

The robot arm is controlled using a single-page web interface served directly from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/robot-arm-web.png)

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board is connected to Wi-Fi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
