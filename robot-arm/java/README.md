# Robot arm in Java*

## What it is

Using a compatible IntelÂ® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a robot arm that:

- continuously checks the Grove\* Joystick.
- moves two stepper motors, based on the control of the joystick.
- can be accessed via a built-in web interface to control the motors.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Stepper motor controller #1 | Digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7
Stepper motor controller #2 | Digital pins 9, 10, 11, and 12
Both controllers to ground (GND) | 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. Java
2. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) 

## Running the program from the command line

This can be easily achieved with basic Maven commands. For this to work you will need to have Maven installed, a guide can be found on the Maven website: <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">https://maven.apache.org/install.html</a>

### Running the program directly on the target 

If you have copied the source files from Git directly on the board and already installed Maven, then you can compile and run the program directly onto the target.
Log in to the board using ssh and navigate to the location of the `pom.xml` file.

First you will need to compile the source files:

	# mvn compile

Then you can execute the program. The following command will run the `main` file in a separate Java process:

	# mvn exec:exec

### Compiling on host machine and deploying to target

If you want to compile the project on your local PC and then deploy it to the target you need to run `mvn package` at the location where the `pom.xml` file exists, or you can specify the file location using the `-f` parameter:

	$ mvn package -f <path_to_pom_file>

This will compile the source files and pack them in `.jar` archives. It will create a folder called `target` where you will find two jars, `RobotArm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `RobotArm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`. The first one contains only the classes from the current module, while the `shaded` version contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies, so running the program using the second jar will be easier since you don't have to worry about adding all the dependency jars to the classpath.

Next step is to copy the generated jar on the target using `scp`. The following command will copy the file to the `home` folder of user `root` on the target:

	$ scp target/RobotArm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar root@<target_ip>:

Then log in on the target using ssh:

	$ ssh root@<target_ip>

Next step is to run the program using `java`, providing the path to the copied jar file and the name of the `main` class:

	# java -cp RobotArm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar howToCodeSamples.RobotArm

You will see output similar to below when the program is running.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.
