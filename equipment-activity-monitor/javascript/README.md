# Equipment activity monitor in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This shop-floor equipment activity monitor application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a shop-floor equipment activity monitor that:<br>
- tracks equipment usage by monitoring sound and vibration sensors.<br>
- issues a visual notification whenever the equipment is in use.<br>
- logs equipment usage using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This equipment activity monitor watches for sound and vibration.

If both exceed a defined threshold, it lights up the display to indicate the equipment is in use.

Once the equipment is no longer used, it clears the display.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for supported boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

In addition to using a compatible platform listed in ![Hardware Compatibility](./../../README.md#hardware-compatibility), here is additional hardware you will need to run this example.

This sample can be used with either Grove or DFRobot components.

1. [Grove\* Base Shield V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html)
2. [Grove\* Sound Sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Sound-Sensor-p-752.html)
3. [Grove\* Piezo Vibration Sensor](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Piezo-Vibration-Sensor-p-1411.html)
4. [Grove\* RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html)

DFRobot\* Starter Kit for Intel® Edison, containing:

1. [Analog Sound Sensor](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=83).
3. [Digital Vibration Sensor](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=79)
4. [LCD Keypad Shield](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/sainsmartks.html)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/equipment-activity-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Sound Sensor | A0
Grove\* Piezo Vibration Sensor | A2
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../images/equipment-activity-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Analog Sound Sensor | A1
Digital Vibration Sensor | A2

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "VIBRATION_THRESHOLD": 100,
  "NOISE_THRESHOLD": 140
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file after the required `VIBRATION_THRESHOLD` and `NOISE_THRESHOLD` keys as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "VIBRATION_THRESHOLD": 100,
  "NOISE_THRESHOLD": 140,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/equipment-activity",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:
