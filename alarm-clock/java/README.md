# Alarm clock in Java*

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a smart alarm clock that:

- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the alarm time.
- displays live weather data on the LCD.
- keeps track of how long it takes you to wake up each morning, using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Rotary Analog Sensor | A0
Grove Button | D4
Grove Buzzer | D5
Grove RGB LCD | I2C

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Buzzer | A1
Button | A2
Rotary Analog Sensor | A3

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. Java
2. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm) 
2. Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, AT&T\* M2X\*, AWS\*, GE\* Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
3. Weather Underground\* API key

## Additional setup

You also want to set the current time zone to match the zone you are in. Do this by using the `timedatectl` program on the board. For example:

    timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles


## Weather Underground\* API key

To optionally fetch the real-time weather information, you need to get an API key from the Weather Underground\* web site:

[http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)

You can still run the example, but without a Weather Underground\* API key you cannot retrive weather data. To run the example with the Underground\* API key you need to change the `WEATHER_API_KEY` key in the `config.properties` file to the one that corresponds to your setup. For example:

```

  WEATHER_API_KEY="YOURKEY"

```


Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to retrieve real-time weather data from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\* you will need to change the `INTEL_IOT_KIT` key in the `config.properties` file to either **GROVEKIT** (this is the default) or **DFROBOTKIT**, depending on which hardware kit you wish to use. For example:

```

  INTEL_IOT_KIT=GROVEKIT

```

## Running the program from the command line

This can be easily achieved with basic Maven commands. For this to work you will need to have Maven installed, a guide can be found on the Maven website: <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">https://maven.apache.org/install.html</a>

### Running the program directly on the target 

If you have copied the source files from Git directly on the board and already installed Maven, then you can compile and run the program directly onto the target.
Log in to the board using ssh and navigate to the location of the `pom.xml` file.

First you will need to compile the source files:

	# mvn compile

Then you can execute the program. The following command will run the `main` file in a separate Java process:

	# mvn exec:exec

### Compiling on host machine and deploying to target

If you want to compile the project on your local PC and then deploy it to the target you need to run `mvn package` at the location where the `pom.xml` file exists, or you can specify the file location using the `-f` parameter:

	$ mvn package -f <path_to_pom_file>

This will compile the source files and pack them in `.jar` archives. It will create a folder called `target` where you will find two jars, `AlarmClock-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `AlarmClock-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`. The first one contains only the classes from the current module, while the `shaded` version contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies, so running the program using the second jar will be easier since you don't have to worry about adding all the dependency jars to the classpath.

Next step is to copy the generated jar on the target using `scp`. The following command will copy the file to the `home` folder of user `root` on the target:

	$ scp target/AlarmClock-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar root@<target_ip>:

Then log in on the target using ssh:

	$ ssh root@<target_ip>

Next step is to run the program using `java`, providing the path to the copied jar file and the name of the `main` class:

	# java -cp AlarmClock-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar howToCodeSamples.AlarmClock


## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix*, AT&T\* M2X\*, AWS\*, GE\* Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)


### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)


### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional back-end data store, you need to change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.properties` file to the server URL and authentication token that correspond to your own data store server setup. For example:

```

  SERVER=http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock
  AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

```

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the target.
