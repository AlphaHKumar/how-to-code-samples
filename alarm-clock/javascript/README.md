# Alarm clock in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart alarm clock application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.
- Invoke the services of the Weather Underground\* API for accessing weather data.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a smart alarm clock that:<br>
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via the built-in web interface to set the alarm time.<br>
- displays live weather data on the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of how long it takes you to wake up each morning, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart alarm clock has a number of useful features. Set the alarm using a web page served directly from the compatible Intel® IoT Platform using your mobile phone. When the alarm goes off, the buzzer sounds and the LCD indicates it’s time to get up. The rotary dial can be used to adjust the brightness of the display.

In addition, the smart alarm clock can access daily weather data via the Weather Underground\* API and use it to change the color of the LCD.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/alarm-clock-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Rotary Analog Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove\* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove Button, and connect the other end to the D4 port on the Grove\* Shield.

3. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove Buzzer, and connect the other end to the D5 port on the Grove\* Shield.

4. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove\* Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../images/alarm-clock-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Buzzer, and connect the other end to the A1 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

2. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Button, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

3. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Rotary Analog Sensor, and connect the other end to the A3 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

### Weather Underground\* API key

To optionally fetch the real-time weather information, you need to get an API key from the Weather Underground\* website:

<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api</a>

You cannot retrieve weather conditions without obtaining a Weather Underground\* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the weather data.

Pass your Weather Underground\* API key to the sample program by modifying the `WEATHER_API_KEY` key in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  WEATHER_API_KEY: "YOURAPIKEY"
}
```

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional real-time weather data, obtain a key from the Weather Underground\* website as documented above, and then change the `WEATHER_API_KEY` and `LOCATION` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the weather data, as well as either the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM\ Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `WEATHER_API_KEY`, `LOCATION`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "WEATHER_API_KEY": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "LOCATION": "San_Francisco"
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/alarm-clock",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run

### Setting the alarm

![](./../../images/js/alarm-clock-web.png)

The alarm is set using a single-page web interface served directly from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
