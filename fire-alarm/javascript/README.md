# Fire alarm in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart fire alarm application is part of a series of how-to Intel IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Set up a web application server to store fire alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub\* from Microsoft\* Azure\*, IoT\* from IBM\* Bluemix\*, or IoT\* from Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.
- Invoke the services of the Twilio* API for sending text messages.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart fire alarm that:<br>
- constantly monitors for unsafe temperature levels;<br>
- issues an audible notification using the buzzer;<br>
- issues a visual notification using the LCD;<br>
- keeps track of fire events, using cloud-based data storage;<br>
- sends text messages to alert others of a possible fire.

## How it works

This smart fire alarm monitors the ambient temperature using the Grove* Temperature Sensor.

If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold (set to 28 degrees Celsius in this example), it sounds an alarm through the buzzer and displays an alert on the LCD.

In addition, it can send a text message to a specified number through Twilio*, warning the recipient of a possible fire danger.

Optionally, it can log fire events using the Intel IoT Examples Datastore running in your own Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS\* account.

Clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository to your Intel® Edison board after you establish an SSH connection to it, as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Then, navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git* on Intel® Edison, if you don’t have it yet, establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

![](./../../images/js/fire-alarm.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove* devices into the Grove* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* Temperature Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* Buzzer, and connect the other end to the D5 port on the Grove* Shield.

3. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove* Shield.

### Manual Intel® Edison setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js* modules needed for this example to execute on Intel® Edison, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

### Twilio* API key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio* web site:

<a href="https://www.twilio.com">https://www.twilio.com</a>

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio* API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

Pass your Twilio* API key and authentication token to the sample program by modifying the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

### Datastore server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), a Machine To Machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio* web site as explained above, and then add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the text messages and the Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on Intel® Edison, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Determining the Intel® Edison IP address

You can determine what IP address Intel® Edison is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see the output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
