# Fire alarm in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart fire alarm application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Set up a web application server to let users enter the access code to disable the alarm system and store this alarm data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT& M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.
- Invoke the services of the Twilio\* API for sending text messages.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a smart fire alarm that:<br>
- constantly monitors for unsafe temperature levels.<br>
- issues an audible notification using the buzzer.<br>
- issues a visual notification using the LCD.<br>
- keeps track of fire events, using cloud-based data storage.<br>
- sends text messages to alert others of a possible fire.

## How it works

This smart fire alarm monitors the ambient temperature using the connected temperature sensor.

If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold (set to 28 degrees Celsius in this example), it sounds an alarm through the buzzer and displays an alert on the LCD.

In addition, it can send a text message to a specified number through Twilio\*, warning the recipient of a possible fire danger.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for supported boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
3. Twilio\* account (optional)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/fire-alarm-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Temperature Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove\* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Buzzer, and connect the other end to the D5 port on the Grove\* Shield.

3. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove\* Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../images/fire-alarm-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Analog Temperature Sensor, and connect the other end to the A3 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

2. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Buzzer, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

### Twilio\* API key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

<a href="https://www.twilio.com">https://www.twilio.com</a>

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio API key first. You can still run the example, but without the text messages.

Pass your Twilio\* API key and authentication token to the sample program by modifying the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28
}
```

To configure the example for sending optional text messages, obtain an API key from the Twilio\* web site as explained above, and then add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

To configure the example for both the text messages and the Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SERVER`, and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "ALARM_THRESHOLD": 28,
  "TWILIO_ACCT_SID": "YOURAPIKEY",
  "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "YOURTOKEN",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```
