# Fire alarm in Java*

## Introduction

This smart fire alarm application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse\* IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to store fire alarm data using Azure\* Redis Cache from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Invoke the services of the Twilio\* API for sending text messages.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.


## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a smart fire alarm that:

- constantly monitors for unsafe temperature levels.
- audibly notifies of alerts using the buzzer.
- visually notifies of alerts using the LCD.
- keeps track of fire alarm data, using cloud-based storage.
- sends text messages to alert others of a possible fire.


## How it works

This smart fire alarm monitors the ambient temperature using the Grove\* Temperature Sensor.

If the temperature is above a certain threshold (set to 28 degrees Celsius for this example), it sounds an alarm through the buzzer and displays an alert on the LCD.

In addition, it can send an SMS to a specified number through Twilio\*, warning them of a possible fire danger.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

3. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove RGB LCD and plug the other end into any of the I2C ports on the Grove Base Shield V2.


### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../../images/js/fire-alarm-dfrobot.jpg)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Analog Temperature Sensor, and connect the other end to the A3 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.

2. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Buzzer, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Keypad Shield.


### Twilio\* API Key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* web site:

[https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

You cannot send text messages without obtaining a Twilio API key first. You can still run the example, but without SMS alerts.

### Configuring the example with your Twilio* API key

Pass your Twilio* API key and authentication token to the sample program by modifying the `TWILIO_ACCT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.properties` file. `NUMBER_TO_SEND_TO` and `TWILIO_OUTGOING_NUMBER` are also part of the Twilio* setup. For example:

```
  TWILIO_ACCT_SID="YOURAPIKEY"
  TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"
  TWILIO_OUTGOING_NUMBER="YOURTWILIOOUTGOINGNUMBER"
  NUMBER_TO_SEND_TO="NUMBERTOSENDTO"
```

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101.

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

The Arduino 101 needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino 101.


### IoT cloud setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)


### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\* you will need to change the `INTEL_IOT_KIT` key in the `config.properties` file to either **GROVEKIT** (this is the default) or **DFROBOTKIT**, depending on which hardware kit you wish to use. For example:

```

  INTEL_IOT_KIT=GROVEKIT

```

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board to Intel® System Studio

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.


### Running the example with the cloud server

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional back-end data store, you need to change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.properties` file to the server URL and authentication token that correspond to your own data store server setup. For example:

```

  SERVER=http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm
  AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

```

Now, when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.


## Running the program using Intel® System Studio IoT Edition

When you're ready to run the example, make sure you have saved all the files.

Click the **Run** icon on the toolbar of Intel® System Studio IoT Edition. This runs the code on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

![](./../../images/java/run_project.png)

You will see output similar to the following when the program is running.

![](./../../images/java/looks_when_running.png)

When the program is uploaded to the Intel® Edison board, the program starts to continuously monitor the temperature. If it exceeds the threshold, the `Fire Alarm!` message is displayed on the LCD.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/fire-alarm-lcd.jpg)

When the temperature sensor is heated, another output message is displayed in the Intel® System Studio console, similar to the image above. This means you sent your SMS alert successfully.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-output-sms-sent.png)


## Running the program from the command line

This can be easily achieved with basic Maven commands. For this to work you will need to have Maven installed, a guide can be found on the Maven website: <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">https://maven.apache.org/install.html</a>

### Compiling on host machine and deploying to Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

If you want to compile the project on your local PC and then deploy it to the target you need to run `mvn package` at the location where the `pom.xml` file exists, or you can specify the file location using the `-f` parameter:

	$ mvn package -f <path_to_pom_file>

This will compile the source files and pack them in `.jar` archives. It will create a folder called `target` where you will find two jars, `FireAlarm-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `FireAlarm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`. The first one contains only the classes from the current module, while the `shaded` version contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies, so running the program using the second jar will be easier since you don't have to worry about adding all the dependency jars to the classpath.

Next step is to copy the generated jar on the target using `scp`. The following command will copy the file to the `home` folder of user `root` on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway:

	$ scp target/FireAlarm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar root@<target_ip>:

Then log in on the target using ssh:

	$ ssh root@<target_ip>

Next step is to run the program using `java`, providing the path to the copied jar file and the name of the `main` class:

	# java -cp FireAlarm-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar howToCodeSamples.FireAlarm


### Running the program directly on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

If you have copied the source files from Git directly on the board and already installed Maven, then you can compile and run the program directly onto the target.
Log in to the board using ssh and navigate to the location of the `pom.xml` file.

First you will need to compile the source files:

	# mvn compile

Then you can execute the program. The following command will run the `main` file in a separate Java process:

	# mvn exec:exec
