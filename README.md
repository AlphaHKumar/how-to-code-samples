# Fire Alarm

Description here...

The "smart" fire alarm requires the following components from the Grove Starter Kit Plus:

1. Intel Edison with Arduino breakout board
2. Grove Temperature Sensor
3. Grove Buzzer
4. RGB LCD display

## How It Works

This "smart" fire alarm will monitor the ambient temperature with the Temperature Sensor.

If the temperature gets above a certain threshold (set to 28 degrees for this example) it sound an alarm through the buzzer and display components.

In the case of a file alarm, if configured it will also optionally send a SMS to a specified number through Twilio.

In addition, you can optionally store the fire alarm stats using the "Intel IoT Example Datastore" running on your own server, such as a Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix account.

## How To Setup

To begin, clone the Intel IoT Examples with git on your computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples.git

Not sure how to do that? [Here is an excellent guide from Github on how to get started](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/).

### Adding The Code To Eclipse IoT

You use the Eclipse "Import Wizard" to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

- From the main menu bar, select "File > Import..."
- The "Import wizard" dialog will open.
- Select "General > Existing Project into Workspace" and click on the "Next" button.
- Choose "Select root directory", then click on the associated "Browse" button to locate the directory that contains the project files.
- Under "Projects" select the directory with the project files which you would like to import.
- Click on the "Finish" button to import the files into Eclipse.

### Connecting The Grove Sensors

You will need to have the Grove Shield connected to the Arduino-compatible breakout board, in order to plug in all the various Grove devices into the Grove shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to the "5V" position.

Plug one end of a Grove cable into the "Temperature Sensor", then connect the other end to the "A0" port on the Grove Shield.

Connect one end of a Grove cable into the "Buzzer", then plug the other end into the "D5" port on the Grove Shield.

Plug one end of a Grove cable into the "RGB LCD", then plug the other end into any of the "I2C" ports on the Grove Shield.

### Intel Edison Setup

This example uses the `restclient-cpp` library to perform REST calls to the server. The code for `restclient-cpp` can be found in the `lib` directory. The `restclient-cpp` library requires the `libcurl` package, which is already installed on the Intel Edison by default.

It also uses the `twilio-cplusplus` library to communcate with the Twilio telephony service. The `twilio-cplusplus` library requires both the `libcurl` package and the `openssl` packages, which are already installed on the Intel Edison by default.

### Running The Code On Edison

When you're ready to run the example, you can click on the "Run" icon located in the menubar at the top of the Eclipse editor.
This will compile the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, link it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfer the binary to the Edison, and then execute it on the Edison itself.

## Data Store Server Setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this example program in a backend database deployed using Node.js, and the Redis datastore. You use your own account on a hosted service such as Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix.

### Connecting Your Edison to the Eclipse IDE

1. In the bottom left corner right-click in the area "Target SSH Conections" select "New..." then select "Connection..." and a new screen will appear. 

![](./../../../ConnectionEclipseIDEWin2.png)
2. In the "filter box" type the name of your edison. In the example mine is JustinEdison.

![](./../../../ConnectionEclipseIDEWin3.png)
3. In the "Select one of the found connections list; click on your device name. Then Ok. 

![](./../../../images/ConnectionEclipseIDEWin4.png)
4. Your device will now appear in the "Target SSH Connections" area. Right-clickt it and select connect. 
(If promted for a username and password the user is 'root' and password is whatever you set it up as when configuring the Edison board)


## Running The Example With The Cloud Server

To run the example with the optional backend datastore you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse by:

1. Select the "Run" menu and choose "Run Configurations". The "Run Configurations" dialog will be displayed.
2. Before running the project be sure sure select your Edison under the "connection" dropdown box. 
3. Click on "fire-alarm" under "C/C++ Remote Application". This will display the information for your application.
4. Add the environment variables to the field for "Commands to execute before application" so it ends up looking like this, except using the server and auth token that correspond to your own setup:

```
chmod 755 /tmp/fire-alarm; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"; export TWILIO_SID="Enter Twilio SID Here"; export TWILIO_TOKEN="Enter Twilio Token Here"; export TWILIO_TO="Enter Number to Send to here Formattted 555-555-5555"; export TWILIO_FROM="Enter Number to be Sent From Here Formated 555-555-5555"
```

5. Click on the "Apply" button to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the "Run" button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Edison.
