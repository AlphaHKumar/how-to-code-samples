# Air quality monitor

This air quality monitor application is part of a series of how-to Intel® IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products. Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run this code sample in Eclipse IoT Edition, an IDE for creating new applications that interact with sensors, actuators, and so on, enabling you to get a quick start on developing software for your Intel® Edison or Galileo board.
- Store air quality data using Azure Redis Cache* from Microsoft* Azure* or Redis Store* from IBM* Bluemix*, both cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a air quality monitor that:
- continuously checks the air quality for airborne contaminants;
- sounds an audible warning when the air quality is unhealthful;
- stores a record of each time the air quality sensor detects contaminants, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This shop air quality monitor will use the sensor to constantly keep track of the airborne contaminants.

If the sensor detects one of several different gases, and the detected level crosses a defined threshold, it will make a sound thru the speaker to indicate a warning.

Optionally, the monitor will also store the air quality data using the "Intel® IoT Example Datastore" running on your own Microsoft* Azure* or IBM* Bluemix*  account.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Home Automation Kit containing:

1. Intel® Edison with an Arduino* breakout board
2. [Grove* Air Quality Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/tp401.html)
3. [Grove* Speaker](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/grovespeaker.html)

### Software requirements

1. [Eclipse*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/eclipse-getting-started-guide)
2. Microsoft* Azure* or IBM* Bluemix* account

## How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples.git

Want to download a .zip file? In your web browser, go to [https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples) and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Adding the program to Eclipse*

In Eclipse*, select **Import Wizard** to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

1. From the main menu, select **File > Import**.<br>
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu.png)

2. The **Import Wizard** dialog box opens.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-epiw.png)

3. Select **General > Existing Project into Workspace** and click **Next**.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menue-epiw-rootdir.png)

4. Click **Select root directory** and then the associated **Browse** button to locate the directory that contains the project files.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-rootdir.png)

5. Under **Projects**, select the directory with the project files you'd like to import.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menue-epiw-rootdir.png)

6. Click **Finish** to import the files into Eclipse*.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-src-loc.png)

Your main .cpp program is now displayed in your workspace under the **src** folder.

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

![](./../../../images/js/air-quality.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino*/-compatible breakout board, to plug all the Grove* devices into the Grove* shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* TP401 Air Quality Sensor, and connect the other end to the "AO" port on the Grove* Shield.
2. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* Speaker, and connect the other end to the "D5" port on the Grove* Shield.

### Intel® Edison setup

This example uses the **restclient-cpp** library to perform REST calls to the remote data server. The code can be found in the **lib** directory. The **restclient-cpp** library requires the **libcurl** package, which is already installed on Intel® Edison by default.

### Datastore server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft* Azure\* or IBM* Bluemix*, Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison to Eclipse*

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win.png)
1. In the bottom left corner, right-click anywhere in the **Target SSH Connections** tab and select **New > Connection**.<br> The **Intel(R) IoT Target Connection** window appears.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win2.png)
2. In the **Filter** field, type the name of your board.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win3.png)
3. In the **Select one of the found connections** list, select your device name and click **OK**.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)
4. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring Intel® Edison.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse* as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the environment variables so it looks like this, except using the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:

```
chmod 755 /tmp/fire-alarm; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/fire-alarm"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"; export TWILIO_SID="Enter Twilio SID Here"; export TWILIO_TOKEN="Enter Twilio Token Here"; export TWILIO_TO="Enter Number to Send to here Formattted 555-555-5555"; export TWILIO_FROM="Enter Number to be Sent From Here Formated 555-555-5555"
```

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from Intel® Edison.

### Running the code on Intel® Edison

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Eclipse*. This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to Intel® Edison, and then executes it on the board itself.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image above.

![](./../../../images/cpp/air-output.png)

After running the program you should have a similar output as in the image above.
