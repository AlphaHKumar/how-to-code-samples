# Storage Unit Flood Detector

This storage unit flood detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel® IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating new applications that interact with sensors, actuators, and so on, enabling you to get a quick start on developing software for your Intel® Edison or Galileo board.
- Store water detection data using Azure Redis Cache* from Microsoft* Azure*, cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.

## What It Is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a storage unit flood detector that:
- continuously checks the moisture sensor;
- sounds an audible warning when it looks like flooding;
- stores a record of each time that water is detected, using cloud-based data storage.

## How It Works

This storage unit flood detector will use the sensor to constantly monitor that your stored belongings are not destroyed by water damage.

If it crosses a defined threshold, it will make a sound to indicate a warning.

The monitor will also, optionally, store the moisture data using the "Intel IoT Example Datastore" running on your own Microsoft Azure account.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Starter Kit containing:

1. Intel® Edison with an Arduino* breakout board
2. [Grove* Moisture Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/grovemoisture.html)
3. [Grove* Buzzer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/buzzer.html)

## Software requirements

1. Eclipse* IoT Edition
2. Microsoft* Azure* account

### How To Setup

To begin, clone the Intel IoT Examples with git on your computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples.git

Not sure how to do that? [Here is an excellent guide from Github on how to get started](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/).

## Adding The Code To Eclipse IoT

You use the Eclipse "Import Wizard" to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

- From the main menu bar, select "File > Import..."
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu.png)

- The "Import wizard" dialog will open.

- Select "General > Existing Project into Workspace" and click on the "Next" button.

- Choose "Select root directory", then click on the associated "Browse" button to locate the directory that contains the project files.

- Under "Projects" select the directory with the project files which you would like to import.

- Click on the "Finish" button to import the files into Eclipse.

- Your main .cpp program will now be in your workspace under the src folder.

### Connecting The Grove* Sensors

![](./../../../images/flood-detect.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board, to plug in all the Grove* devices into the Grove* shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Shield set to "5V".

Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the "Grove* Moisture Sensor", and connect the other end to the "A0" port on the Grove* Shield.

Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the "Grove* Speaker", and connect the other end to the "D5" port on the Grove* Shield.

### Microsoft Azure server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this example program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure, Node.js, and a Redis data store.

For information on how to setup your own cloud data server, go to:

https://github.com/hybridgroup/intel-iot-examples-datastore

## Configuring The Example

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure data store, change the `config.json` file for the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys as follows:

```
{
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/flood-detect"; "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```
### Running The Code On Edison

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

When you're ready to run the example, you can click on the "Run" icon located in the menubar at the top of the Eclipse editor.
This will compile the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, link it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfer the binary to the Edison, and then execute it on the Edison itself.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

After running the program you should have a similar output as in the image above.

You will then get a moisture output from the sensor in the console. telling you if it is dry, moist, or wet.

When the sensor detects enough moisture it will send a signal to the server and the console output will inform you of this.
