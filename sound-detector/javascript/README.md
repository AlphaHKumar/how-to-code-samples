# Sound Detector in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart sound detector application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Store this sound data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a smart loudness detector system that:<br>
- monitors a microphone sensor to detect the loudness in the area.<br>
- keeps track of the sound levels, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This sound detector monitor uses the sensor to constantly keep track of the decibel level in a room. Every 100 ms the sensor finds the average sound samples and prints them to the LCD screen.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for supported boards and libraries.

### Hardware requirements

In addition to using a compatible platform listed in ![Hardware Compatibility](./../../README.md#hardware-compatibility), here is additional hardware you will need to run this example

This sample can be used with either Grove\* or DFRobot\* components.

Grove\* Starter Kit Plus, containing:

1. [Grove\* Base Shield V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html)
2. [Grove Sound Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/microphone.html).
3. [Grove RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html).

Starter Kit for Intel® Edison/Galileo from DFRobot\*, containing:

2. [Analog Sound Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/loudness.html).
3. [LCD Keypad Shield](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/sainsmartks.html).

### Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/sound-detector-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Sound Sensor | A0
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

Analog Sound Sensor | A2

### IoT cloud setup (optional)
 
You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example 

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file below the "THRESHOLD" value as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:
