# Sound detector in C++

## Introduction

This sound detector application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® IoT Gateway, Intel® Edison board, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse\* IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or Intel® Galileo board.
- Store the sound data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a smart loudness detector system that:<br>
- monitors a microphone sensor to detect the loudness in the area.<br>
- keeps track of the sound levels, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This sound detector monitor uses the sensor to constantly keep track of the decibel level in a room. Every 100 ms the sensor finds the average sound samples and prints them to the LCD screen.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

![](./../../images/cpp/project-src-imported.png)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/java/sound-detector.jpg)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the Grove\* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove\* Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot\* cable into the Analog Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A2 port on the LCD Display Shield.

### Intel® Edison board setup

This example uses the **restclient-cpp** library to perform REST calls to the remote data server. The code can be found in the **lib** directory. The **restclient-cpp** library requires the **libcurl** package, which is already installed on the Intel® Edison board by default.

### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

The Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

### IoT cloud setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example for your hardware kit

To configure the example for the specific hardware kit that you are using, either Grove\* or DFRobot\*:

1. From the main menu, select **Project > Properties** dialog box is displayed.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-project-properties.png)
2. Expand the section **C/C++ General**. <br>Click on the **Paths and Symbols** sub-section, and click on the **Symbols** tab.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gen-path-symbols.png)
3. Now click on **GNU C++**, and click on the **Add** button.
![](./../../images/cpp/click-gnupp-add.png)
4. In the **Name** field, enter "INTEL_IOT_KIT". In the **Value** field, enter either "GROVEKIT" (this is the default) or "DFROBOTKIT", depending on which hardware kit you wish to use.
![](./../../images/cpp/add-name-and-var.png)
5. Your new name symbol and value will now be displayed. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/name-var-ok.png)
6. Another dialog box will appear asking to rebuild project. Click **OK**.
![](./../../images/cpp/path-symbol-rebuild-ok.png)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System Studio

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/sound-detector;export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/equipment-activity"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board Intel® IoT Gateway.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Intel® System Studio.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board Intel® IoT Gateway, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

Successful output should be similar to the one in the image below.<br>
