# Sound Detector in Python*

## Introduction

This sound detector system application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Store loudness data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart loudness detector system that:<br>
- monitors a microphone sensor to detect the loudness in the area.<br>
- keeps track of access, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This sound detector monitor uses the sensor to constantly keep track of the decibel level in a room.
Every 1sec the sensor finds the average sound samples and prints it to the RGB lcd screen.

Additionally, various events (looking-for-motion, motion-detected, invalid-code, etc.) are logged.
Optionally, all data can be stored using the Intel® IoT Examples Datastore running in your own Microsoft Azure account.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Starter Kit Plus containing:

1. Intel® Edison platform with an Arduino* breakout board
2. [Grove Sound Sensor](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/microphone.html)
3. [Grove RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html).

## Software requirements

1. Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS account (optional)

### How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

To download a .zip file, in your web browser go to <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples">https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples</a> and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Installing the program manually on the Intel® Edison board

Alternatively, you can set up the code manually on the Intel® Edison board.

Clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository to your Intel® Edison board after you establish an SSH connection to it, as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Then, navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git\* on the Intel® Edison board (if you don’t have it yet), establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/java/sound-detector.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Sound Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Shield.

### Manual Intel® Edison board setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison board manually, you will need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Python\* packages needed for this example to execute on the Intel® Edison board:

Establish an SSH connection to the board and navigate to the directory with this example.

Then run the following commands:

    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft\* Azure\*, IBM\* Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the optional data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file to the server URL and authentication token that correspond to your own data store server setup. For example:

```JSON
{
    "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/sounddetector"
    "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}

## Running the program manually

To run the example on the Intel® Edison board, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following commands:

Navigate to the directory with this example on the Edison.

Then run the following command:

    $ python .

### Determining the Intel® Edison board's IP address

You can determine what IP address the Intel® Edison board is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see the output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
