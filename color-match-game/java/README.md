# Color match game in Java*

## Introduction

This color match game application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, Intel® IoT Gateway, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies:

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway, computing platforms designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to let users play the color matching game using their web browser.


## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board or or Intel® IoT Gateway, this project lets you create a color match game.<br>
- a UI of the game is exposed through an embedded server, providing with buttons for color matching as well as a "start game" button<br>
- when starting the game, for each level a sequence of colors is displayed on the RGB LCD screen of the Intel® Edison board or Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) board. The player needs to click on the corresponding buttons on the website.
- for each level the sequence has one more color.<br>
- when a user clicks a color, the same color is displayed on the RGB LCD screen.<br>

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../../images/python/color-match-game.jpg)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove Shield.


### Intel® IoT Gateway setup

You can run this example using an Intel® IoT Gateway connected to an Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).

Make sure your Intel® IoT Gateway is setup using Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, by following the directions on the web site here:

https://software.intel.com/en-us/getting-started-with-intel-iot-gateways-and-iotdk

The Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.) needs to have the Firmata\* firmware installed. If you have IMRAA installed on your gateway, this will be done automatically. Otherwise, install the StandardFirmata or ConfigurableFirmata sketch manually onto your Arduino 101\* (branded Genuino 101\* outside the U.S.).


### IoT cloud setup

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)


### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\*, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)


### Connecting your Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway to Intel® System Studio

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.


## Running the program using Intel® System Studio IoT Edition

When you're ready to run the example, make sure you have saved all the files.

Click the **Run** icon on the toolbar of Intel® System Studio IoT Edition. This runs the code on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway.

![](./../../images/java/run_project.png)

You will see output similar to the following when the program is running.

![](./../../images/java/looks_when_running.png)


## Running the program from the command line

This can be easily achieved with basic Maven commands. For this to work you will need to have Maven installed, a guide can be found on the Maven website: <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html">https://maven.apache.org/install.html</a>

### Compiling on host machine and deploying to Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

If you want to compile the project on your local PC and then deploy it to the target you need to run `mvn package` at the location where the `pom.xml` file exists, or you can specify the file location using the `-f` parameter:

	$ mvn package -f <path_to_pom_file>

This will compile the source files and pack them in `.jar` archives. It will create a folder called `target` where you will find two jars, `ColorMatchGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` and `ColorMatchGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`. The first one contains only the classes from the current module, while the `shaded` version contains the classes from the current module and its dependencies, so running the program using the second jar will be easier since you don't have to worry about adding all the dependency jars to the classpath.

Next step is to copy the generated jar on the target using `scp`. The following command will copy the file to the `home` folder of user `root` on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway:

	$ scp target/ColorMatchGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar root@<target_ip>:

Then log in on the target using ssh:

	$ ssh root@<target_ip>

Next step is to run the program using `java`, providing the path to the copied jar file and the name of the `main` class:

	# java -cp ColorMatchGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar howToCodeSamples.ColorMatchGame


### Running the program directly on the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway

If you have copied the source files from Git directly on the board and already installed Maven, then you can compile and run the program directly onto the target.
Log in to the board using ssh and navigate to the location of the `pom.xml` file.

First you will need to compile the source files:

	# mvn compile

Then you can execute the program. The following command will run the `main` file in a separate Java process:

	# mvn exec:exec



## Regenerating the HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
We have a useful tutorial on how to use the shell script here:

[how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](./../../docs/cpp/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)


### Accessing the game

![](./../../images/java/color-match-game-web.JPG)

The color match game is set using a single-page web interface served from the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`, so if the Intel® Edison board or Intel® IoT Gateway are connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000/`.
