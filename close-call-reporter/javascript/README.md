## What it is

Using a compatible IntelÂ® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a close call fleet driving reporter that:<br>
- monitors the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter.<br>
- monitors the Grove\* GPS.<br>
- keeps track of close calls and logs them using cloud-based data storage.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter | D2
Grove\* GPS | UART port

## DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
IR Distance Sensor | D4
GPS cable TX (white) | RX pin
GPS cable RX (black) | TX pin
GPS cable power (red) | 5V pins
GPS cable ground (thicker black) | GND

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
    
### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.
