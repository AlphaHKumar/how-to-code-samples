# Close call reporter in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This close call fleet driving reporter application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT)code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Store the close-call data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a close call fleet driving reporter that:<br>
- monitors the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter.<br>
- monitors the Grove\* GPS.<br>
- keeps track of close calls and logs them using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This close call reporter system monitors the direction the IR Distance sensor is pointed to.

It also keeps track of the GPS position, updating the position frequently to ensure accurate data.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for supported boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements
In addition to using a compatible platform listed in ![Hardware Compatibility](./../../README.md#hardware-compatibility), here is additional hardware you will need to run this example

This sample can be used with either Grove or DFRobot components.

Grove\* Transportation and Safety Kit, containing:

1. [Grove\* Base Shield V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html)
2. [Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/rfr359f.html)
3. [Grove\* GPS](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/ublox6.html)

DFRobot\* Starter Kit for Intel® Edison, containing:

2. [IR Distance Sensor](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=572)
3. [GPS](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/ublox6.html)
4. [I/O Expansion Shield](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1009)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/close-call-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove\* IR Distance Interrupter, and connect the other end to the D2 port on the Grove\* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove\* GPS, and connect the other end to the UART port on the Grove\* Shield.

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../images/close-call-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a DFRobot\* I/O Expansion Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the DFRobot\* I/O Expansion Shield.

1. Plug one end of a DFRobot cable into the IR Distance Sensor, and connect the other end to the D4 port on the I/O Expansion Shield.

2. Plug the attached GPS cable TX (white) to the I/O Expansion Shield's RX pin. Plug the attached GPS cable RX (black) to the I/O Expansion Shield's TX pin. Plug the attached GPS cable power (red) to any of the I/O Expansion Shield's 5V pins. Plug the attached GPS cable ground (thicker black) to any of the I/O Expansion Shield's GND.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, change the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/access-control",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```
