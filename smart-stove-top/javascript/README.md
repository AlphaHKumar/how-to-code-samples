# Smart stove top in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This smart stove top application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>

- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Set up a web application server to set the target temperature and store this data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a smart stove top that:<br>
- allows you to set a target temperature.<br>
- monitors your stove and notifies you when your set temperature is reached.<br>
- stores historical temperature data using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart stove top sensor has a number of useful features designed to help you monitor the temperature of the food you are cooking on your legacy stove top.
Set the target temperature for a pot on your range top via a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board, using your mobile phone.

When the target temperature is reached, the speaker issues an audible notification. If an open flame from a pot boiling over is detected, alarm goes off.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../smart-stove-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* IR Temperature Sensor | A0
Grove\* Flame Sensor | D4
Grove\* Speaker | D5

### Connecting the DFRobot\* sensors

![](./../smart-stove-dfrobot.JPG)

You need to have a LCD Keypad Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the DFRobot\* devices into the LCD Keypad Shield.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### Data store server setup (optional)

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys in the `config.json` file after the required `TARGET_TEMP` key as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "TARGET_TEMP": 30,
  "SERVER": "http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/smart-stovetop",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run

### Setting the temperature

![](./../../images/js/smart-stove-web.png)

The target temperature is set using a single-page web interface served from the Intel® IoT Platform while the sample program is running.

The web server runs on port `3000`; if the Intel® IoT Platform is connected to Wi-Fi on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.

### Determining your platform's IP Address

See the section on Finding Your Board's IP Address at the bottom of the ![Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#finding-your-boards-ip-address) readme.
