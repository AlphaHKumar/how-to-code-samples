# Smart stove top in C++

## Introduction

This smart stove top application is part of a series of how-to Intel® Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison board, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:

- Connect the Intel® Edison board, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison board IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run these code samples in the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (Eclipse IDE for C/C++ and Java\* development) for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison board or the Intel® Galileo board.
- Set up a web application server to set the temperature and store this temperature data using Azure\* Redis Cache from Microsoft, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or ElastiCache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Set up a MQTT-based server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, or IoT from Amazon Web Services\* (AWS), different cloud machine to machine messaging services based on the industry standard MQTT protocol.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a smart stove top that:

- monitors the temperature using the sensor and gives an audible notification when your food reaches the desired temperature and you need to turn down the heat.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via a built-in web interface to set the desired temperature.
- monitors for a possible fire, by using the attached flame sensor, and gives an urgent audible warning.
- keeps track of the cooking temperature using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

This smart stove top sensor has a number of useful features designed to help you monitor the temperature of the food you are cooking on your legacy stove top.

You can set the target temperature for a pot on your range top using a web page served directly from the Intel® Edison board, using your mobile phone.

When the target temperature is reached, the speaker gives an audible notification. If an open flame from a pot boiling over is detected, an alarm sounds.

Optionally, the smart stove top sensor can store events using the Intel® IoT Examples Data store or an MQTT server running in your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS account.

![](./../../images/cpp/import-iot-examples.png)
2. Expand the tree view for **C++ > How To Code Samples > Smart Stovetop** and click **Import Example**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/click-how-to-code-samples.png)
3. Select your developer board from the selection window then select **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/select-board.png)
4. Select **Intel® IoT C/C++ project** from the Select a project type window then click **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/select-project-type.png)
5. Select **Yocto** from the Selct target OS dropdown menu then click **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/select-os.png)
6. The next tab will ask for connection name and target name. If you do not know these click **Search Target**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/search-target.png)
7. Select your Edison from the dropdown list. Select **OK**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/click-how-to-code-samples.png)
8. Your connection name and target name should be filled in. Select **Finish**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/finish-target.png)
9. A new window will open for you and you will need to choose a name for your project and click **Next**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/enter-project-name.png)
10. Your project source files will now be available on the on the upper left of your IDE by default.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/project-src-imported.png)

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

You need to have a Grove* Base Shield V2 connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Base Shield V2. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Base Shield V2 set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove IR Temperature Sensor, and connect the other end to the A0 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.<br>
![](./../../images/js/smart-stove.jpg)
2. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Flame Sensor, and connect the other end to the D4 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.
3. Plug one end of a Grove cable into the Grove Speaker, and connect the other end to the D5 port on the Grove Base Shield V2.

### Data store server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a back-end database deployed using Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS, along with Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### MQTT server setup

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), a Machine To Machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-mqtt)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison board to Eclipse

1. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional back-end data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Eclipse as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables so it looks like this, except using the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/smart-stovetop;export API_KEY="YOURKEY"; export SERVER="http://intel-examples.azurewebsites.net/counter/logger/smart-stove"; export AUTH_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® Edison board.

### Running the code on the Intel® Edison board

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Eclipse.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to the Intel® Edison board, and then executes it on the board itself.

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow* web server.

 For help using the shell script, go to this link:

[how-to-run-the-shellscript.md](./../../docs/cpp/how-to-run-the-shellscript.md)

### Setting the temperature

The target temperature is set using a single-page web interface served up from the Intel® Edison board while the sample program is running.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/smrt-rng-app.png)

The web server runs on port `3000`; if the Intel® Edison board is connected to WiFi* on `192.168.1.13`, the address to browse to if you are on the same network is `http://192.168.1.13:3000`.
