# Watering system in C++

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create an automatic watering system that:

- turns a water pump on and off based on a configurable schedule.
- detects if the watering system is pumping when expected, by using a water flow sensor.
- can be accessed with your mobile phone via a built-in web interface to set the watering intervals.
- keeps track of the watering system, using cloud-based data storage.
- sends text messages to alert the user if the system if not working as expected.

## First time setup
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for required boards and libraries.  You need either Grove\* or DFRobot\* sensors but not both.

## Hardware requirements

### Grove\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay | D4
One wire from the pump | 5V power source
Other wire from pump | One of the Power connectors on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board
Other power connector  on the Grove\* Dry-Reed Relay board | 5V power source reserved for the pump
Water Flow Sensor | Red wire into the 5V pin, the black wire into the GND pin, and the yellow wire into digital pin 2
Grove\* Moisture Sensor | A0

### DFRobot\*

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Relay Module | A1
One wire from the pump | GND of the power source
Other wire from the pump | NC (Normally Closed) connector on the Relay Module
COM (Common) connector | + of the 5V power source
Moisture Sensor | A3

For more specific information on the hardware requirements see ![Hardware Details](./../README.md#hardware-requirements)

## Software requirements

1. ![MRAA](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) and ![UPM](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm)
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)
3. Twilio\* account

Note: The following libraries are included with the repo and already linked to in the code -jsoncpp -restclient

### Copy the libraries on Windows\*

For help installing and using WinSCP, go to this link:

[using-winscp.md](./../../docs/cpp/using-winscp.md)

Note: You need to turn SSH on by running the `configure_edison --password` command on the board. Once you set the password, make sure you write it down. You only need to do this once and it is set when you reboot the Intel® Edison board.

### Twilio\* API Key

To optionally send text messages, you need to register for an account and get an API key from the Twilio\* website:

[https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)

You can still run the example, but without a Twilio API key you cannot send SMS alerts.

## Running the program

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ make
    $ build
    $ ./watering-system
    
After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

Successful output should be similar to the one in the image below.<br>
![](./../../images/cpp/cpp-equp-act-mon-successful-output.png)

Refer to ![How it Works](./../README.md#how-it-works) for details on the functionality.

## Running the example with the cloud server

To run the example with the optional backend data store, you need to set the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables. You can do this in Intel® System Studio as follows:

1. From the **Run** menu, select **Run Configurations**.<br> The **Run Configurations** dialog box is displayed.
2. Under **C/C++ Remote Application**, click **doorbell**.<br> This displays the information for the application.
3. In the **Commands to execute before application** field, add the following environment variables, except use the server and authentication token that correspond to your own setup:<br>

        chmod 755 /tmp/watering-system; export SERVER="http://intel-iot-example-data.azurewebsites.net/logger/watering-system"; export AUTH_TOKEN="Enter Auth Token Here"; export TWILIO_SID="Enter Twilio SID Here"; export TWILIO_TOKEN="Enter Twilio Token Here"; export TWILIO_TO="Enter Number to Send to here Formattted 555-555-5555"; export TWILIO_FROM="Enter Number to be Sent From Here Formated 555-555-5555"

4. Click **Apply** to save your new environment variables.

Now when you run your program using the **Run** button, it should be able to call your server to save the data right from the Intel® IoT Platform.

## Regenerating HTML and CSS

If you make any changes to either the **index.html** or **styles.css** file, you need to regenerate the .hex file used to serve up the assets via the built-in Crow\* web server.
