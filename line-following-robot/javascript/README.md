# Line following robot in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This line following robot application is part of a series of how-to Internet of Things (IoT) code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Interface with and sensors using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Store line detection data using Azure Redis Cache\* from Microsoft Azure\*, Redis Store\* from IBM Bluemix\*, or Elasticache\* using Redis\* from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, different cloud services for connecting IoT solutions including data analysis, machine learning, and a variety of productivity tools to simplify the process of connecting your sensors to the cloud and getting your IoT project up and running quickly.
- Connect to a server using IoT Hub from Microsoft Azure\*, IoT from IBM Bluemix\*, IoT from Amazon Web Services (AWS)\*, AT&T M2X\*, Predix\* from GE, or SAP Cloud Platform\* IoT, different cloud-based IoT platforms for machine to machine communication.

## What it is

Using a compatible Intel® IoT Platform, this project lets you create a line following robot that:<br>
- continuously checks the line finder sensor.<br>
- moves forward if on the line, using the stepper motors.<br>
- tries to pivot to find the line if not on it, using the stepper motors.<br>
- logs events from the line finder sensor, using cloud-based data storage.

## How it works

The line finder robot uses the two attached motors to attempt to follow a line, keeping track of it with the line finder sensor. If on the line, it moves forward. Otherwise, it pivots in place, trying to locate it using the line finder sensor.

Optionally, data can be stored using your own Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for supported boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

In addition to using a compatible platform listed in ![Hardware Compatibility](./../../README.md#hardware-compatibility), here is additional hardware you will need to run this example.

Grove\* Robotics Kit containing:

1. [Grove\* Base Shield V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html)
2. [Grove Line Finder](http://iotdk.Intel®.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/grovelinefinder.html)
3. [Stepper Motor Controller & Stepper Motor](http://iotdk.Intel®.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/uln200xa.html) (x2)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 
2. Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* account (optional)

### Connecting the Grove\* sensors

![](./../images/line-follower-grove.JPG)

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\* compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove devices into the Grove Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove Shield set to **5V**.

You need to power the Intel® IoT Platform with the external power adapter that comes with your starter kit, or substitute it with an external 12V 1.5A power supply. You can also use an external battery, such as a 5V USB battery.

In addition, you need a breadboard and an extra 5V power supply to provide power to both motors. Note: you need a separate battery or power supply for the motors. You cannot use the same power supply for both the Intel® IoT Platform and the motors, so you need either 2 batteries or 2 power supplies in total.

1. Plug each of the stepper motor controllers into four pins on the Arduino\* breakout board for it to be able to be controlled. Connect stepper motor controller #1 to pins 4, 5, 6, and 7. Connect stepper motor controller #2 to pins 9, 10, 11, and 12. Connect both controllers to ground (GND), to the 5V power coming from the Arduino\* breakout board (VCC), and to the separate 5V power for the motors (VM).

2. Plug one end of a Grove\* cable into the Grove\* Line Finder, and connect the other end to the D2 port on the Grove\* Shield.

### IoT cloud setup (optional)

You can optionally store the data generated by this sample program using cloud-based IoT platforms from Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/iot-samples-cloud-setup)

### MQTT server setup (optional)

You can also optionally store the data generated by this sample program using MQTT, a machine-to-machine messaging server. You can use MQTT to connect to Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, or AWS\*.

For information on how to connect to your own cloud MQTT messaging server, go to:

[https://github.com/Intel®-iot-devkit/Intel®-iot-examples-mqtt](https://github.com/Intel®-iot-devkit/Intel®-iot-examples-mqtt)

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Intel® IoT Platform, just leave the `platform` key in the `config.json` set to `edison`. To configure the example for the Intel® IoT Gateway, change the `platform` key in the `config.json` to `firmata` as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "firmata",
  "CLOCKWISE": 1,
  "WHITE_LINES": 0
}
```

To configure the example for the optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, or AWS\* data store, add the `SERVER` and `AUTH_TOKEN` keys to the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "platform": "edison",
  "CLOCKWISE": 1,
  "WHITE_LINES": 0,
  "SERVER": "http://Intel®-examples.azurewebsites.net/logger/line-follower",
  "AUTH_TOKEN": "s3cr3t"
}
```

For information on how to configure the example for an optional Microsoft Azure\*, IBM Bluemix\*, AT&T M2X\*, AWS\*, Predix\*, or SAP\* IoT cloud server, go to:
