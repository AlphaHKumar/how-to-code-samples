# Earthquake detector in JavaScript*

## Introduction

This earthquake detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:<br>
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.<br>
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.<br>
- Run this code sample in Intel® XDK IoT Edition, an IDE for creating applications that interact with sensors and actuators, enabling a quick start for developing software for the Intel® Edison or Intel® Galileo board.<br>
- Invoke the services of the United States Geological Survey* (USGS*) API for accessing earthquake data.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create an earthquake detector that:<br>
- senses motion using the digital accelerometer;<br>
- checks live earthquake data, using the USGS* API;<br>
- displays the earthquake on the LCD.

## How it works

This earthquake detector constantly reads the 3-axis digital accelerometer looking for movement that could indicate an earthquake.

When it thinks it detects an earthquake, it attempts to verify with the USGS* API that an earthquake actually occurred.

If so, it displays a warning on the LCD.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Starter Kit Plus containing:

1. Intel® Edison with an Arduino* breakout board
2. [Grove* 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/mma7660.html)
3. [Grove* RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html)

## Software requirements

1. Intel® XDK IoT Edition

### How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Want to download a .zip file? In your web browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples">https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples</a> and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

## Adding the program to Intel® XDK IoT Edition

In Intel® XDK IoT Edition, select **Import Your Node.js Project**:

![](./../../images/js/xdk-menu.png)

On the **New Project** screen, click on the folder icon:

![](./../../images/js/xdk-new-project.png)

Then, navigate to the directory where the example project exists, and select it:

![](./../../images/js/xdk-select.png)

Choose a name for the project, then click on the **Create** button. Then click on the **Continue** button to finish creating your project:

![](./../../images/js/xdk-new-project-name.png)

You need to connect to your Intel® Edison board from your computer to send code to it.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-select-device.png)

Click the **IoT Device** menu at the bottom left. If your Intel® Edison is automatically recognized, select it.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-manual-connect.png)

Otherwise, select **Add Manual Connection**.
In the **Address** field, type `192.168.2.15`. In the **Port** field, type `58888`.
Click **Connect** to save your connection.

### Installing the program manually on Intel® Edison

Alternatively, you can set up the code manually on the Intel® Edison board.

Clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository to your Intel® Edison board after you establish an SSH connection to it, as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/how-to-code-samples.git

Then, navigate to the directory with this example.

To install Git* on Intel® Edison, if you don’t have it yet, establish an SSH connection to the board and run the following command:

    $ opkg install git

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

![](./../../images/js/earthquake-detector.jpg)

You need to have a Grove* Shield connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove* devices into the Grove* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove* Shield.

2. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* RGB LCD, and connect the other end to any of the I2C ports on the Grove* Shield.

### Manual Intel® Edison setup

If you're running this code on your Intel® Edison manually, you need to install some dependencies.

To obtain the Node.js* modules needed for this example to execute on Intel® Edison, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Configuring the example

To configure the example to check for earthquakes in your area, change the `LATITUDE` key in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "LATITUDE": "47.641944",
  "LONGITUDE": "-122.127222"
}
```

## Running the program using Intel® XDK IoT Edition

When you're ready to run the example, make sure you saved all the files.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-upload.png)

Click the **Upload** icon to upload the files to the Intel® Edison board.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-run.png)

Click the **Run** icon at the bottom of Intel® XDK IoT Edition. This runs the code on Intel® Edison.

![](./../../images/js/xdk-upload-run.png)

If you made changes to the code, click **Upload and Run**. This runs the latest code with your changes on Intel® Edison.

![](./../../images/js/earthquake-detector-output.png)

You will see output similar to the above when the program is running.

## Running the program manually

To run the example manually on Intel® Edison, establish an SSH connection to the board and execute the following command:

    node index.js

### Determining the Intel® Edison IP address

You can determine what IP address Intel® Edison is connected to by running the following command:

    ip addr show | grep wlan

You will see the output similar to the following:

    3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.1.13/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global wlan0

The IP address is shown next to `inet`. In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.13`.
