## What it is

Using a compatible IntelÂ® IoT Platform, this project lets you create an earthquake detector that:<br>
- senses motion using the digital accelerometer.<br>
- checks live earthquake data, using the USGS API.<br>
- displays the earthquake on the LCD.

## First time setup  
For all the samples in this repository, see the ![General Setup Instructions](./../../README.md#setup) for requested boards and libraries.

## Hardware requirements

You need to have a Grove\* Shield connected to an Arduino\*-compatible breakout board to plug all the Grove\* devices into the Grove\* Shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove\* Shield set to **5V**.

Sensor | Pin
--- | ---
Grove\* 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer | I2C
Grove\* RGB LCD | I2C

More details on the hardware requirements can be found in the ![project README](./../README.md)

## Software requirements

1. Node.js 
2. MRAA and UPM Node.js bindings <link to mraa and upm install docs>
2. Packages as listed in the package.json file in this example 

## Configuring the example

To configure the example for the Grove\* kit, just leave the `kit` key in the `config.json` set to `grove`. To configure the example for the DFRobot\* kit, change the `kit` key in the `config.json` to `dfrobot` as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "dfrobot"
}
```

To configure the example for the Arduino\*/Genuino\* 101, add a `platform` key with the value `firmata` to the `config.json`, as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "platform": "firmata"
}
```

To configure the example to check for earthquakes in your area, change the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` keys in the `config.json` file as follows:

```
{
  "kit": "grove",
  "LATITUDE": "47.641944",
  "LONGITUDE": "-122.127222"
}
```

## Running the program 

To run this example on the board, simply enter

    $ npm install
    $ npm run
