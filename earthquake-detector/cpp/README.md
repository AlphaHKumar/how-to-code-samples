# Earthquake detector

## Introduction

This earthquake detector application is part of a series of how-to Intel® IoT code sample exercises using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, Intel® Edison development platform, cloud platforms, APIs, and other technologies.

From this exercise, developers will learn how to:
- Connect the Intel® Edison development platform, a computing platform designed for prototyping and producing IoT and wearable computing products.
- Interface with the Intel® Edison platform IO and sensor repository using MRAA and UPM from the Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution to help developers explore the IoT and implement innovative projects.
- Run this code sample in Eclipse* IoT Edition, an IDE for creating new applications that interact with sensors, actuators, and so on, enabling you to get a quick start on developing software for your Intel® Edison or Galileo board.
- Invoke the services of the United States Geological Survey* API for accessing earthquake data.

## What it is

Using an Intel® Edison board, this project lets you create a earthquake detector that:
- senses motion using the digital accellerometer;
- checks live earthquake data, using the USGS* API.
- displays the earthquake on the LCD;

## How it works

This earthquake detector will constantly read the 3-axis digital accelerometer looking for movement that could indicate an earthquake.

When it thinks it detects an earthquake, it will attempt to verify with the USGS* API that an earthquake actually occurred

If so, it will use the LCD Display to warn of the quake.

## Hardware requirements

Grove* Starter Kit containing:

1. Intel® Edison with an Arduino* breakout board
2. [Grove* 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/mma7660.html)
3. [Grove* RGB LCD](http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/node/classes/jhd1313m1.html)

## Software requirements

1. [Eclipse*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/eclipse-getting-started-guide)

## How to set up

To begin, clone the **How-To Intel IoT Code Samples** repository with Git* on your computer as follows:

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples.git

Want to download a .zip file? In your web browser, go to [https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples) and click the **Download ZIP** button at the lower right. Once the .zip file is downloaded, uncompress it, and then use the files in the directory for this example.

### Adding the program to Eclipse*

In Eclipse*, select **Import Wizard** to import an existing project into the workspace as follows:

1. From the main menu, select **File > Import**.<br>
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu.png)

2. The **Import Wizard** dialog box opens.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-epiw.png)

3. Select **General > Existing Project into Workspace** and click **Next**.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menue-epiw-rootdir.png)

4. Click **Select root directory** and then the associated **Browse** button to locate the directory that contains the project files.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-select-rootdir.png)

5. Under **Projects**, select the directory with the project files you'd like to import.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menue-epiw-rootdir.png)

6. Click **Finish** to import the files into Eclipse*.
![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-eclipse-menu-src-loc.png)

Your main .cpp program is now displayed in your workspace under the **src** folder.

### Connecting the Grove* sensors

![](./../../../images/js/earthquake-detector.jpg)

You will need to have the Grove* Shield connected to the Arduino\*-compatible breakout board, in order to plug in all the various Grove* devices into the Grove* shield. Make sure you have the tiny VCC switch on the Grove* Shield set to **5V**.

1. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* Accelerometer, then connect the other end to any of the "I2C" ports on the Grove* Shield.
2. Plug one end of a Grove* cable into the Grove* RGB LCD, then connect the other end into any of the "I2C" ports on the Grove* Shield.

### Intel® Edison setup

This example uses the **restclient-cpp** library to perform REST calls to the remote data server. The code can be found in the **lib** directory. The **restclient-cpp** library requires the **libcurl** package, which is already installed on Intel® Edison by default.

### Datastore server setup

Optionally, you can store the data generated by this sample program in a backend database deployed using Microsoft* Azure\* or IBM* Bluemix*, Node.js\*, and a Redis\* data store.

For information on how to set up your own cloud data server, go to:

[https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/intel-iot-examples-datastore)

### Connecting your Intel® Edison to Eclipse*

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win.png)
1. In the bottom left corner, right-click anywhere in the **Target SSH Connections** tab and select **New > Connection**.<br> The **Intel(R) IoT Target Connection** window appears.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win2.png)
2. In the **Filter** field, type the name of your board.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win3.png)
3. In the **Select one of the found connections** list, select your device name and click **OK**.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-connection-eclipse-ide-win4.png)
4. On the **Target SSH Connections** tab, right-click your device and select **Connect**.

If prompted for the username and password, the username is **root** and the password is whatever you specified when configuring Intel® Edison.

### Running the code on Intel® Edison

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse.png)

When you're ready to run the example, click **Run** at the top menu bar in Eclipse*. This compiles the program using the Cross G++ Compiler, links it using the Cross G++ Linker, transfers the binary to Intel® Edison, and then executes it on the board itself.

![](./../../../images/cpp/cpp-run-eclipse-successful-build.png)

After running the program, you should see output similar to the one in the image above.

![](./../../../images/cpp/earthquake-lcd.jpg)

When the the program loads correctly your Grove* RGB LCD screen will display "quakebot ready."

If you shake the accelerometer it will check to see if there really was an earthquake!
